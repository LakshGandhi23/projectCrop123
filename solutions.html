                <h2>MSP for all crops</h2>
                <p>
                    The government can consider implementing a system of MSP for all crops. This would provide a
                    guaranteed price to farmers for their produce, thereby protecting them from price fluctuations and
                    exploitation by middlemen. The MSP can be determined based on a formula that considers the cost of
                    production, a minimum profit margin, and other relevant factors.

                <p>
                    The government can introduce schemes to provide debt relief to farmers. This could involve loan
                    waivers, restructuring of loans, or providing subsidies on interest payments. This would help to
                    alleviate the financial burden on farmers and improve their overall financial viability.

                <p>
                    The government can establish a pension scheme for farmers and farm laborers. This would provide them
                    with a source of income in their old age and improve their social security.

                <p>
                    The government can increase investment in rural infrastructure, such as irrigation facilities,
                    roads, and storage facilities. This would improve the efficiency of agricultural production and
                    reduce post-harvest losses.

                <h2>Promoting Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)</h2>
                <p>
                    The government can encourage the formation of FPOs, which are groups of farmers who come together to
                    improve their bargaining power and access to markets. This would help farmers to get better prices
                    for their produce and reduce their dependence on middlemen.

                <p>
                    The government can improve transparency and communication with farmers by regularly consulting with
                    them on agricultural policies and ensuring that their concerns are addressed. This would help to
                    build trust and cooperation between the government and the farming community.
